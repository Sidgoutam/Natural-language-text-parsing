# Natural-language-text-parsing
Install the natural language tool kit (Use the link).
www.nltk.org
. After installing in your corresponding operating system, open the python editor (IDLE in my case) and type 
"import nltk"
and run it.
This will import the installed tool kit in your python.
Next in the same python file type 
"nltk.download()"
. A pop-up window appears where on clicking the download button, nltk will be downloaded.
